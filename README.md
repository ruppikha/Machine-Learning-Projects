# Project Name: Bangalore Price Prediction & Credit Card Fraud Detection & SMS Spam Detection

## Overview:
This project consists of three separate modules for predicting house prices in Bangalore, detecting credit card fraud, and identifying SMS spam messages. Each module includes relevant Jupyter notebooks and necessary files for model building, testing, and deployment.

## Modules:

### 1. Bangalore Price Prediction:
- **File:** Bangalore House Price Prediction.ipynb
- **Description:** This notebook contains the code for predicting house prices in Bangalore. It involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
- **Dataset:** Cleaned_data.csv

### 2. Credit Card Fraud Detection:
- **File:** Credit Card Fraud Detection.ipynb
- **Description:** This notebook focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and testing.
- **Dataset:** Refer to the notebook

### 3. SMS Spam Detection:
- **Files:**
  - App.py
  - sms_spam_detection.ipynb
  - README.md
  - Dataset.csv
  - model.pkl
  - vectorizer.pkl
- **Description:** This module deals with identifying spam messages in SMS. It contains a Flask application (`App.py`) for deploying the model, a Jupyter notebook (`sms_spam_detection.ipynb`) for model development, and necessary data and model files.
- **Dataset:** Dataset.csv
- **Model Files:**
  - model.pkl: Serialized machine learning model for spam detection.
  - vectorizer.pkl: Serialized vectorizer for text data preprocessing.

## Instructions:
- Each module is self-contained and can be used independently.
- Follow the instructions provided within each notebook for data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
- For SMS Spam Detection, run the Flask application (`App.py`) to deploy the model for real-time predictions.
